# Crypto Dash App - Trend Page Demo

This repository contains the trend page of [cryptodashapp.com](https://www.cryptodashapp.com).

For demo purposes, the scope of the app is reduced to a single (trend) page. Some of the areas this app can serve as an example is as follows:
* Creating a responsive Dash App
* Using bootstrap for styling
* Multiple pages & navigation via side bar
* Custom period selector to apply across different visualizations

If you wish to run the app with Anaconda:

1 - Open a terminal window

2 - Clone the app either using:

      ssh -> git clone git@github.com:CanerIrfanoglu/crpyto-dash-trend.git 
      
      or
      
      https -> git clone https://github.com/CanerIrfanoglu/crpyto-dash-trend.git
      
3 - Create new conda environment to prevent interfering with existing packages by running `conda create --name py38 python=3.8` (optional)

4 - Install required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`

5 - Run the app via: `python app.py`
